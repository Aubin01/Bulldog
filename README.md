# 🌟 Bulldog: AI vs Human Coding 🌟
`A project exploring the effects of AI on coding by comparing AI-generated and human-written implementations of the Bulldog game.`

## 🚀 Project Overview
` This repository includes two implementations of the Bulldog game along with a comparative report analyzing the differences between the AI-generated and human-written programs:`

📁 **BulldogAI** → Programs written by AI (ChatGPT-4).  
📁 **BulldogME** → Programs written by me.  
📁 **A comparative report**  

` The goal of this project is to examine how AI-generated code compares to human-written code in **structure, efficiency, accuracy, and usability**.`
